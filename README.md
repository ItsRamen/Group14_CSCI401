# Group14_CSCI401
Our project for CSCI 401 by Group 14.

For our capstone project we decided to focus on a Python based program that allows for encryption and decryption in AES. 
On the day of our presentation we will have one person to act as a Host and client, while also running a remote access attack
to demostrate how hackers can steal files and decrpyt data stored in the victims computer and possibly modify said data.
